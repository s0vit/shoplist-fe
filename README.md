## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- PNPM >= 9.0.0

We are using pnpm as a package manager. To install it, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Usage

After installation, you can:

1. **Login or Register**: Create an account or log in to an existing one
2. **Add Expenses**: Track your spending by adding new expenses
3. **Categorize**: Organize expenses by categories
4. **Filter and Sort**: Find specific expenses using filters
5. **Manage Profile**: Update your user information and preferences
6. **View Reports**: Analyze your spending patterns (coming soon)

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

### Build

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Testing

The project includes both end-to-end and unit tests:

```bash
# Run end-to-end tests
pnpm run test:e2e

# Run end-to-end tests with UI
pnpm run test:e2e:debug

# Run unit tests
pnpm run test:unit
```

### Storybook
```bash
# Storybook will be available at http://localhost:6006
pnpm run storybook   
 
# Static Storybook build
pnpm run build-storybook 
```

### Linting and Formatting

The project enforces a clean commit history and consistent code style out‑of‑the‑box.

| Stage          | Tooling           | Command run by Husky               |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **pre‑commit** | ESLint + Prettier | `pnpm lint:fix && pnpm format:fix` |
| **commit‑msg** | Commitlint        | `pnpm commitlint --edit $1`        |

Manual commands:

```bash
# Run linter
pnpm run lint

# Fix linting issues
pnpm run lint:fix

# Check formatting
pnpm run format

# Fix formatting issues
pnpm run format:fix
```

### Conventional Commits

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec; commit messages are validated by Commitlint.

Instead of git commit, run Commitizen’s interactive wizard:
```bash
pnpm cm   
```

The wizard will ask for:

- **type** – feat / fix / refactor / test / docs / style / chore / build (required)

- **scope** – scope of this change (required)

- **description** – short imperative summary (required)

- **details** - longer description of the change (optional)

_Example: fix(auth): change login timeout_

Hooks ensure that commits failing the spec are rejected.
